The encroachment of the neutrino fog has driven an increase in interest towards a technique which has the potential to circumvent the limit entirely: directional detection. The technique aims to measure the strongly anisotropic angular distribution of the dark matter wind incident on Earth as we journey around the Milky Way galaxy. The potential for dark matter discovery with directional detectors greatly exceeds that of conventional detectors, so the concept is well worth investigation if we 1) want to extend the search for dark matter well into the neutrino fog, or 2) wish to confirm a potential signal of dark matter without relying on the controversial and systematic-prone annual modulation. While in practice directional detectors are several years away from being at a competitive scale, there several promising approaches under investigation. The CYGNUS collaboration in particular is developing a competitive global network of directional detectors using modular gas time projection chambers.

The problem is that we do not really know what the dark matter is. However, we do have some very good candidates for it. I will discuss to what extent current and future experimental efforts will be able to verify our ideas and/or open up other perspectives.","tags":["Theory Seminar","Dark Matter"],"title":"Direct detection of dark matter - a theorist’s perspective","type":"event"},{"authors":["David Shih"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619686800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619686800,"objectID":"8c970fe0993e68534bf2e0adf8562b40","permalink":"/event/shih_2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/shih_2021/","section":"event","summary":"In recent years, there has been growing interest and many new ideas for anomaly detection and model-independent new physics searches at the LHC, enabled by powerful advances in deep learning.

However, the expansion rate currently inferred from measurements of the cosmic microwave background now disagrees with that obtained from supernova measurements. Over the past few years, theorists have been exploring the possibility that this Hubble tension is explained by some new \"early dark energy\": a new component of matter that may have been dynamically important several hundred thousand years after the Big Bang.","tags":["Theory Seminar","Hubble tension"],"title":"The Hubble tension and early dark energy","type":"event"},{"authors":["Pierre Sikivie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618477200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618477200,"objectID":"e55692ee48c05d16f88674ace9502d18","permalink":"/event/sikivie_2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/sikivie_2021/","section":"event","summary":" The axion is a hypothetical particle motivated by the strong CP problem of elementary particle physics and by the dark matter problem of cosmology. Cold dark matter axions are naturally produced during the QCD phase transition in the early universe by a process of vacuum realignment. They thermalize later by gravitational self-interactions and form a Bose-Einstein condensate as a result of this thermalization. I'll discuss special properties that may allow us to distinguish axion dark matter from the other dark matter candidates on observational grounds.  I'll also discuss various methods to detect axion dark matter directly on Earth, and report on the experimental efforts under way.","tags":["Theory Seminar","Axions","Dark Matter"],"title":"Axion Dark Matter","type":"event"},{"authors":["Dominik Stöckinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617375600,"objectID":"67de3a236368201a180aea3089bfdda0","permalink":"/event/stockinger_2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/stockinger_2021/","section":"event","summary":"For two decades, the Brookhaven $g-2$ measurement has remained a tantalizing deviation from the SM prediction and a potential indication for physics beyond the SM (BSM).
