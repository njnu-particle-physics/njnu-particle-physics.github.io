Cold dark matter axions are naturally produced during the QCD phase transition in the early universe by a process of vacuum realignment. They thermalize later by gravitational self-interactions and form a Bose-Einstein condensate as a result of this thermalization. I'll discuss special properties that may allow us to distinguish axion dark matter from the other dark matter candidates on observational grounds.  I'll also discuss various methods to detect axion dark matter directly on Earth, and report on the experimental efforts under way.","tags":["Theory Seminar","Axions","Dark Matter"],"title":"Axion Dark Matter","type":"event"},{"authors":["Dominik Stöckinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617375600,"objectID":"67de3a236368201a180aea3089bfdda0","permalink":"/event/stockinger_2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/stockinger_2021/","section":"event","summary":"For two decades, the Brookhaven $g-2$ measurement has remained a tantalizing deviation from the SM prediction and a potential indication for physics beyond the SM (BSM).
