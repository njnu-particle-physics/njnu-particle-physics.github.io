SUMMARY:Timothy Cohen - Dark Sector Searches at the LHC
DESCRIPTION:It is plausible that the dark matter is a remnant of a hidden sector that involves new strongly coupled dynamics akin to Standard Model QCD. Such a dark sector could lead to a variety of signatures at the LHC, and its imprint could be lurking within subtle properties of jet substructure. In this talk, I will discuss the status of dark sector searches at the LHC. I will introduce our simplified model-like parameterization for the collider signatures of semi-visible jets. These objects are characterized by a jet like spray of QCD hadrons that is aligned with invisible dark matter hadrons, a generic feature of parton showers. I will highlight recent ATLAS and CMS searches for semi-visible jets. I will then explain our state-of-the-art prediction for the theory error on substructure distributions. I will show recent work where we argue that the Lund Jet Plane provides a simple representation to isolate the incalculable effects of dark sector fragmentation and hadronization. This will facilitate more robust LHC searches for these exciting signatures in the future.
