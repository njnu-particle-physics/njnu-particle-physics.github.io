SUMMARY:Francesco Sannino - The Future of Composite Dynamics: From composite Higgs to composite dark sectors
DESCRIPTION:I will show how novel composite dynamics is a primary candidate to explain all of or some of the SM anomalies from the observation of lepton-flavour non universality to $g-2$ and the recent observation of the $W$-mass anomaly. I will also show how composite dark sectors can be constrained by the next generation of gravitation wave detectors. Last but not least I will discuss how and when new composite dynamics could emerge at collider experiments.
