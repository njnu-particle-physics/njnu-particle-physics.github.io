SUMMARY:Jim Cline, Benoit Laurent, Jean-Samuel Roux - Leptogenesis and Gravity Waves from a SUSY-breaking Phase Transition
DESCRIPTION:It has been shown that supersymmetry breaking in a hidden sector at the PeV scale can lead to adistinctive strong first order phase transition, producing gravity waves that could be observed in upcoming experiments. We develop this idea, proposing a concrete model with gauge-mediated SUSY breaking, that can also give successful leptogenesis at the phase transition. A novel mechanism of neutrino mass generation at one loop arises in the model. We show that significant production of primordial black holes can take place at the phase transition.
