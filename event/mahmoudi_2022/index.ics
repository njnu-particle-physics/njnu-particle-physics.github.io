SUMMARY:Nazila Mahmoudi - Search for new physics with rare B decays
DESCRIPTION:Recently, several consistent deviations from the Standard Model predictions have been measured in flavour physics observables, and in particular in semileptonic B decays. In this presentation, I will discuss thier new physics implications within a model-independent approach and make projections for future measurements that indicate that LHCb will be in the position to discover lepton non-universality with the Run 3 data in a single observable.
