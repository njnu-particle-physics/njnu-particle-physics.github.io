SUMMARY:Cheng-Wei Chiang - Phenomenological Studies of the Georgi-Machacek Model
DESCRIPTION:With theoretical constraints such as perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability conditions and updated experimental data of Higgs measurements and direct searches for exotic scalars at the LHC, we perform an updated scan of the allowed parameter space of the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model. With the refined global fit, we examine the allowed parameter space for inducing strong first-order electroweak phase transitions and find only the one-step phase transition is phenomenologically viable. Based upon the result, we study the associated gravitational wave signals and find most of which can be detected by several proposed experiments. We also make predictions on processes that may serve as promising probes to the GM model in the near future at the LHC, including the di-Higgs productions and several exotic scalar production channels.
