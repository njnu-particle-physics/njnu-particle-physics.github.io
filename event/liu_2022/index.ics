SUMMARY:Cheng-Pang Liu - Spin-Dependent Dark Matter-Electron Interactions 
DESCRIPTION:Direct searches of sub-GeV dark matter (DM) through its scattering with electrons have attracted lots of attention in recent years. Stringent exclusion limits placed on the spin-independent interactions are reported, and will be improved in next-generation experiments, with some of them employing novel detector designs. The subject of this talk is the spin-dependent interactions, which, unlike their counterpart in the DM-nucleon sector, have yet been extensively addressed. I will discuss (1) their theoretical motivations, (2) expected signals in direct search experiments and exclusion limits, and (3) differences in the detector responses from the spin-independent ones, including new ideas to increase the difference so as to achieve further distinguishability.
