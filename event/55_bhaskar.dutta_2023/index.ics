SUMMARY:Bhaskar Dutta - Light mediator models for the dark sector
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, I will first discuss the low mass mediator models with specific examples. These models contain new particles, e.g. light mediators, dark matter candidates, etc. I will discuss various ways of detecting these models in the ongoing/upcoming experiments which include the ongoing and planned neutrino experiments, FASER, LHC etc. which would include new detection/production channels. Some of these dark sector models also can explain the excess of electron-like events at MiniBooNE.
