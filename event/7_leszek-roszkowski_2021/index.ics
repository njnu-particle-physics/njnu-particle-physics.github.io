SUMMARY:Leszek Roszkowski - Direct detection of dark matter - a theoristâ€™s perspective
DESCRIPTION:Measurement of a signal in direct detection of a hypothetical particle constituting the dark matter in the Universe  would provide arguably the most convincing proof of its nature. The problem is that we do not really know what the dark matter is. However, we do have some very good candidates for it. I will discuss to what extent current and future experimental efforts will be able to verify our ideas and/or open up other perspectives.
