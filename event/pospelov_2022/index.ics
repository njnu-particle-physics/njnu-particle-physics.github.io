SUMMARY:Maxim Pospelov - Accelerated light dark matter
DESCRIPTION:Light dark matter particles (MeV range) carry too little energy to be seen with current dark matter detectors. Considerable efforts are being spent on lowering the energy thresholds for detection. I will show that these models can be successfully constrained using a double collision scheme. First collision with e.g. solar electrons/cosmic ray particles/accelerator beam can bring the dark matter to detectable energies, with subsequent scattering of accelerated dark matter leaving detectable energy deposition in large neutrino and/or dark matter detectors. This scheme currently provides leading sensitivity to light dark matter in a wide range of masses and cross sections.
