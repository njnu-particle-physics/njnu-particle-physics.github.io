SUMMARY:Michael Betancourt - Some Ruminations On The Interplay Between Bayesian Inference and Machine Learning
DESCRIPTION:The diversity of concepts, terminologies, and interpretations in the broader machine learning community make it difficult to narrow down exactly what machine learning is, let alone compare it to more formal notions of learning like Bayesian inference.  In this talk I will review the foundations of Bayesian inference, and the common impediments to its effective implementation in practice, before comparing and contrasting these ideas to some popular machine learning approaches and discussing the potential opportunities for collaboration.
