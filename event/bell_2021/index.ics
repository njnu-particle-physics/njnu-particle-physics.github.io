SUMMARY:Nicole Bell - Dark Matter Capture in Stars
DESCRIPTION:The capture of dark matter in stars provides a cosmic laboratory in which to study the nature of dark matter particles and their interactions. We outline an improved treatment of the dark matter capture process, which correctly incorporates a number of important, yet previously overlooked, physical effects. We discuss observational consequences for capture in the Sun, white dwarfs and neutron stars.
