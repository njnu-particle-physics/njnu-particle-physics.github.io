SUMMARY:Jens Erler - A Tale with Precision
DESCRIPTION:The role of precision tests of the Standard Model is reviewed. Historically, they were key in establishing the theory and to verify its renormalizable structure, as well as the presence of radiative corrections. Today the emphasis has shifted to the determination of its parameters to very high accuracy and to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. Some future prospects will also be discussed.
