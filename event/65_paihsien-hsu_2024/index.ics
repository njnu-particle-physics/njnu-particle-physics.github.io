SUMMARY:Pai-hsien Jennifer Hsu - Quantum Entanglement in the Large Hadron Collider
DESCRIPTION:Recently there has been a growing interest in the measurements of quantum properties with collider experiments, and the ATLAS collaboration has reported the first observation of entanglement of top-antitop pairs last year (Nov. 2023). In this talk, I will present the measurements of quantum entanglement of top-anitop pairs of the ATLAS and CMS experiments, and discuss the proposals of measuring entanglement with the bosonic decay channels of the Higgs boson.
