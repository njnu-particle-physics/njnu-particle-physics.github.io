SUMMARY:Jonathan Feng - FASER and Forward Physics at the LHC
DESCRIPTION:For decades, the focus of searches for new particles at the energy frontier has been on heavy particles and high $p_T$. Recently, however, new ideas have led to novel opportunities for discovery in the forward region with relatively fast, small, and cheap experiments. In this talk, I will give an overview of the physics motivations, including both BSM and SM physics; describe FASER, currently being installed at the LHC; and present a few new initiatives, including a forward LAr detector and the Forward Physics Facility.
