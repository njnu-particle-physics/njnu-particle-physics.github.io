SUMMARY:Daniel Stolarski - Confining Hidden Sectors at LHC and Beyond
DESCRIPTION:I will describe my research program on searches for confining hidden sectors at the GeV scale. I will focus on a collider object we have termed Emerging Jets, which can arise when there is a confining dark sector connected to the Standard Model by a TeV scale mediator. The signature of an emerging jet is O(10) displaced vertices inside the jet each with a different impact parameter, and a small number of prompt tracks. I will describe some of the experimental searchers performed as a result of our work. I will also explore how future detectors could be well suited to discovery of such a scenario. Finally, I will describe some new trigger possibilities that can improve sensitivity to emerging jets with relatively low energy.
