SUMMARY:Chris McCabe - Hunting for sub-GeV dark matter with gas-based detectors
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, I’ll discuss ideas for new approaches in the hunt for light dark matter was gas-based detectors. Firstly, I’ll discuss the sensitivity that may be achievable through the process of electron ionisation of gas targets in a Spherical Proportional Counter, paying particular attention to the potential benefits of molecular gas targets. Secondly, I’ll review the Migdal effect and discuss ongoing attempts to measure the effect in a neutron-nuclear scattering process with a CF4 gas mixture in an Optical Time Projection Chamber.
