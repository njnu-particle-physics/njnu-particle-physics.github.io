SUMMARY:Jens Erler - A Tale with Precision
DESCRIPTION:The role of precision tests of the Standard Model is reviewed. Historically, they were key in establishing the theory and to verify its renormalizable structure, as well as the presence of radiative corrections. Today the emphasis has shifted to the determination of its parameters to very high accuracy and to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. Some future prospects will also be discussed.

SUMMARY:Takaaki Kajita - Neutrino Oscillations
DESCRIPTION:Neutrinos have been assumed to have no mass. If neutrinos have mass, neutrino oscillations should occur. Neutrino oscillations were discovered by studying atmospheric and solar neutrinos. I will discuss the discovery of neutrino oscillations, the status of the oscillation studies and the future prospects for neutrino oscillation experiments.

SUMMARY:Sabine Hossenfelder - Superdeterminism: The Forgotten Solution
DESCRIPTION:What is a measurement? This, it turns out, is the most difficult question in physics today. In this talk, I will explain why the measurement problem is important and why all attempts to solve it so far have failed. I will then discuss the obvious solution to the problem that was, unfortunately, discarded half a century ago without ever being seriously considered: Superdeterminism. After addressing some common objections to this idea, I will summarize the existing approaches to develop a theory for it.

SUMMARY:Maggie  MÃ¼hlleitner - The Higgs Boson - A Dissection Tool for New Physics
DESCRIPTION:The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS at the Large Hadron Collider marked a milestone for elementary particle physics. In the meantime the properties of the discovered Higgs boson have been investigated, and the Higgs turns out to behave very Standard Model (SM)-like. The SM of particle physics furthermore has been tested to great accuracy at the quantum level. However, there are open questions like e.g. the nature of Dark Matter or why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe, that cannot be answered by the SM. This calls for new physics beyond the SM. So far unfortunately, we do not have any direct sign of new physics. In this situation the role of the Higgs boson becomes extremely important as a dissection tool in our search for physics beyond the SM. I will highlight in my talk the special role of the Higgs boson for our understanding of the true model underlying particle physics. I will present selected examples that demonstrate what can be learnt from the Higgs boson on physics beyond the SM and how it may guide our way in our quest for the model that allows us to describe nature and help us to understand the true picture behind it.

SUMMARY:Yvonne Wong - Precision effective number of neutrinos $N_\textrm{eff}$
DESCRIPTION:Many beyond-Standard-Model theories predict light and feebly interacting states that can be efficiently produced in the early universe.   From the cosmological perspective, these states behave like Standard-Model neutrinos and can impact on a variety of cosmological observables including the light element abundances from primordial nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.  It is common to quantify the energy density residing in these light states in terms of its contribution to the effective number of thermalised neutrino species, $N_\textrm{eff}$, where the Standard-Model value (accounting for the energy density in 3 families of Standard-Model neutrinos) is $N_\textrm{eff} = 3.044$.  In this talk, I will discuss first of all the signatures of additional light species in cosmological observables, current observational constraints on the $N_\textrm{eff}$ parameter and prospects for improving these constraints with future CMB experiments.  I will then report on a recent precision theoretical calculation of the Standard-Model expectation for the $N_\textrm{eff}$ parameter, performed by two independent groups, both of which found to five-significant-digit agreement $N_\textrm{eff}^\textrm{SM} = 3.0440 \pm 0.0002$.

u$NS) and invisible meson decays to lepton flavour universality violation.

SUMMARY:Francesco Sannino - The Future of Composite Dynamics: From composite Higgs to composite dark sectors
DESCRIPTION:I will show how novel composite dynamics is a primary candidate to explain all of or some of the SM anomalies from the observation of lepton-flavour non universality to $g-2$ and the recent observation of the $W$-mass anomaly. I will also show how composite dark sectors can be constrained by the next generation of gravitation wave detectors. Last but not least I will discuss how and when new composite dynamics could emerge at collider experiments.

SUMMARY:Igor Ivanov - Navigating the parameter space of the 3HDMs
DESCRIPTION:The simple idea of several Higgs generations is the basis of the $N$-Higgs-doublet model and leads to many model-building opportunities and rich phenomenology. The 2HDM remains a very popular BSM playground, but much interest is now devoted to exploration of the 3HDMs. However, the phenomenological richness of the 3HDM comes at a price: the number of free parameters becomes so large that straightforward numerical scans of the entire parameter space are of little use and cannot reveal all the phenomenologically attractive situations. One must organize the 3HDM exploration in a smarter way. In this talk, after a brief historical overview of the 3HDMs, I will present several results obtained in the past decade which now allow for systematic and efficient exploration of various 3HDM scenarios. The key points are the complete classification of symmetry groups available in the 3HDM scalar sector, their breaking patterns, their CP properties, their fermion sector and DM consequences, and the basis-invariant methods for the 3HDM.

SUMMARY:Georg Weiglein - Confronting BSM physics with the latest experimental results
DESCRIPTION:The present status of particle physics and some open questions motivating physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) are briefly reviewed. Theoretical predictions for BSM physics are confronted with the latest experimental results. In particular, recent results for the CP properties of the observed Higgs boson and its trilinear couplings are discussed, and possible experimental hints for additional Higgs bosons at about 400 GeV and about 95 GeV are analysed. Some examples for the interplay between collider physics and cosmology in probing extended Higgs sectors are highlighted. Furthermore, recently reported deviations between the measured values and the Standard Model predictions for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the mass of the W boson are discussed.

SUMMARY:Mark Goodsell - Automating generic phenomenology
DESCRIPTION:Experimental searches typically publish limits on not only specific models, but specific scenarios within a model. For a theorist to confront a different model or scenario to the latest limits therefore requires a whole chain of tools and calculations to map from Lagrangian parameters to data. With the immense range of possible models now under consideration this begs for automation and genericity. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the state of the art of this toolchain and the current challenges within the context of the SARAH package, which allows phenomenologists to go from a theory defined at any energy scale to precision computations and collider tools at the push of a button. I will also talk about my recent work on generic unitarity calculations and their relation to dark matter.

In this talk will present an overview of the recent advances in the field. I will then briefly discuss the implications of the Higgs-mass prediction on a non-minimal SUSY model that features two pairs of Higgs doublets, and provides a solution to the g-2 anomaly thanks to a suitable enhancement of the muon Yukawa coupling.

SUMMARY:David "Doddy" Marsh - Axion Quasiparticles for Axion Dark Matter Detection
DESCRIPTION:It has been suggested that certain antiferromagnetic topological insulators contain axion quasiparticles (AQs), and that such materials could be used to detect axion dark matter (DM). I review recent progress in this direction. I begin by clarifying the effective theory, and introducing a model for material losses. Current progress on material candidates is discussed, of which there is considerable and rapid progress happening in materials science, especially in China. The DM-AQ resonance mechanism is explained, following the principle of the dielectric haloscope. AQ-photon mixing leads to an effective photon mass near the antiferromagnetic resonance, changing the optical properties of the material, and allowing for resonant axion DM-photon conversion in samples large compared to the axion Compton wavelength. The proposal could allow for detection of axion DM in the mass range between 1 and 10 meV. Once the axion quasiparticle is detected in materials, the main hurdles to dark matter detection will be: losses in the material, and efficient THz photon counters.

SUMMARY:Michael Ramsey-Musolf - Was There an Electroweak Phase Transition?
DESCRIPTION:The possible existence of beyond Standard Model physics at the TeV scale or below has important implications for the thermal history of electroweak symmetry-breaking. A first order phase transition -- not possible in the minimal Standard Model with a 125 GeV Higgs boson -- would provide the preconditions for electroweak baryogenesis and the generation of primordial gravitational radiation. I discuss recent developments in assessing this possibility that rely on the combination of EFT methods and non-perturbative (lattice) computations. I also discuss implications for high energy collider phenomenology and next generation gravitational wave searches.

SUMMARY:Tony Gherghetta - New 5D Perspectives on the QCD Axion
DESCRIPTION:The QCD axion provides a solution to both the strong CP and dark matter problems in the Standard Model. However, the axion solution requires that the gravitational violation of the Peccei-Quinn global symmetry be suppressed to an extremely high order. This so-called axion quality problem can be addressed in 5D models that predicts flavor-dependent axion-fermion couplings. Moreover, 5D models also allow for the intriguing possibility that the axion mass could be much larger. These features have implications for the ongoing experimental axion searches as well as new possibilities in early universe cosmology.

SUMMARY:Roberto Trotta - StratLearn: A general-purpose method for supervised learning under covariate shift with applications to observational cosmology
DESCRIPTION:Supervised machine learning will be central in the analysis of upcoming large-scale sky surveys. However, selection bias for astronomical objects yields labelled training data that are not representative of the unlabelled target data distribution. This affects the predictive performance with unreliable target predictions and poor generalization.
I will present StratLearn, a novel and statistically principled method to improve supervised learning under such covariate shift conditions, based on propensity score stratification. In StratLearn, learners are trained on subgroups ("strata") of the data conditional on the propensity scores, leading to improved covariate balance and much-reduced bias in the model fit.
This general-purpose method has promising applications in observational cosmology, improving upon existing conditional density estimation of galaxy redshift from Sloan Data Sky Survey (SDSS) data; in the classification of Supernovae (SNe) type Ia from photometric data, it obtains the best reported AUC on the âSNe photometric classification challengeâ. If time allows, I'll discuss the embedding of such a classification into a full analysis of SNe data to estimate cosmological parameters.

SUMMARY:Anne Green - Primordial Black Holes as a dark matter candidate
DESCRIPTION:Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are black holes formed in the early Universe, for instance from the collapse of large density perturbations generated by inflation. The discovery of gravitational waves from mergers of ~10 Solar mass black hole binaries has led to increased interest in PBHs as a dark matter candidate. I will review the formation of PBHs and the limits on their abundance. I will also emphasize key open questions in the field (e.g. the probability distribution of the density perturbations from which PBH form, clustering, and methods for constraining asteroid mass PBHs).

SUMMARY:Howie Haber - Why is the Higgs boson SM-like?
DESCRIPTION:The properties of the Higgs boson discovered in 2012 at the LHC are consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model (SM), to within the accuracy of the present LHC Higgs data.  Nevertheless, there are numerous motivations to suggest that the scalar sector of the fundamental theory of particles is likely to be non-minimal, in contrast to the minimal scalar sector of the SM.   If an extended Higgs sector exists, then why should the observed Higgs boson closely resemble the Higgs boson of the SM?  In this talk, I examine the possibility that the Higgs boson is SM-like due to a softly-broken symmetry,   The size of the corresponding soft-breaking terms ultimately determines the small deviations of the Higgs couplings from their SM values, which can be discovered in future LHC running (or at a Higgs factory that may eventually follow).  If such a scenario can be realized, then it would provide a natural explanation for the SM-like properties of the observed Higgs boson, while allowing for the existence of new scalars (and perhaps other new particles beyond the SM) whose presence can be probed in future runs at the LHC.

These resources could be used to extend the search program in new directions. As an example, the proposal of an anomalous event dataset will be discussed.

SUMMARY:Matthew Buckley - Unsupervised Machine Learning in Astrophysical Data
DESCRIPTION:Large astrophysical surveys provide us with a wealth of data that has important implications for fundamental physics questions. Fully exploiting these datasets requires new techniques and approaches, including machine learning. However, it is difficult to completely simulate many astrophysical systems. As a result, unsupervised learning techniques can be particularly useful for these astrophysical questions. I discuss two applications of unsupervised machine learning to astrophysical data: discovering stellar streams and measuring the local Galactic density.

DESCRIPTION:Recent data in B-meson decays indicate a coherent pattern of deviations from the Standard Model predictions. These 'anomalies' provide a perfect playground for using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) in a bottom-up approach, not only to set limits on the scale of the New Physics, but also to extract precise indications about the nature of physics beyond the SM. I will discuss, in particular, how present data points toward new dynamics not far from the TeV scale,  possibly by linked to the origin of fermion mass hierarchies, and to the unification of quarks and leptons. Implications for future measurements both at low and high-energies are also briefly discussed.

SUMMARY:Ciaran O'Hare - Venturing into the neutrino fog
DESCRIPTION:The last few years have seen the largest underground dark matter searches rapidly approach their purported ultimate sensitivity limit, which is increasingly being referred to as the "neutrino fog". An experiment reaches the neutrino fog went it becomes so large and so sensitive that the background from coherent scattering of astrophysical neutrinos begins to masquerade as dark matter, thereby preventing any conclusive identification of a signal. The encroachment of the neutrino fog has driven an increase in interest towards a technique which has the potential to circumvent the limit entirely: directional detection. The technique aims to measure the strongly anisotropic angular distribution of the dark matter wind incident on Earth as we journey around the Milky Way galaxy. The potential for dark matter discovery with directional detectors greatly exceeds that of conventional detectors, so the concept is well worth investigation if we 1) want to extend the search for dark matter well into the neutrino fog, or 2) wish to confirm a potential signal of dark matter without relying on the controversial and systematic-prone annual modulation. While in practice directional detectors are several years away from being at a competitive scale, there several promising approaches under investigation. The CYGNUS collaboration in particular is developing a competitive global network of directional detectors using modular gas time projection chambers. I will give an overview of the status of neutrino backgrounds to dark matter searches and then describe ongoing work trying to bring the concept of directional detection to reality.

More specifically, I will discuss how the coloured Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons invalidate the Peccei-Quinn axion solution to the strong CP problem and suggest that the genuine axionic solution of the problem must involve an additional companion axion. Some phenomenological and cosmological aspects of the companion axion model will be presented.

DESCRIPTION: The axion is a hypothetical particle motivated by the strong CP problem of elementary particle physics and by the dark matter problem of cosmology. Cold dark matter axions are naturally produced during the QCD phase transition in the early universe by a process of vacuum realignment. They thermalize later by gravitational self-interactions and form a Bose-Einstein condensate as a result of this thermalization. I'll discuss special properties that may allow us to distinguish axion dark matter from the other dark matter candidates on observational grounds.  I'll also discuss various methods to detect axion dark matter directly on Earth, and report on the experimental efforts under way.

Soon the new Fermilab $g-2$ measurement will publish its first data. In view of this we present an overview of the current situation and discuss general properties of BSM contributions to muon $g-2$.

SUMMARY:John Ellis - Fundamental Physics from Gravitational Waves
DESCRIPTION:The recent observations of gravitational waves have opened new opportunities in astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics, some of which can be explored using atom interferometers. These include the formation of supermassive black holes, searches for a graviton mass and Lorentz violation, probes of possible phase transitions in the early Universe, and the possible existence of cosmic strings.
