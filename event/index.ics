SUMMARY:Anne Green - Primordial Black Holes as a dark matter candidate
DESCRIPTION:Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are black holes formed in the early Universe, for instance from the collapse of large density perturbations generated by inflation. The discovery of gravitational waves from mergers of ~10 Solar mass black hole binaries has led to increased interest in PBHs as a dark matter candidate. I will review the formation of PBHs and the limits on their abundance. I will also emphasize key open questions in the field (e.g. the probability distribution of the density perturbations from which PBH form, clustering, and methods for constraining asteroid mass PBHs).

SUMMARY:Howie Haber - Why is the Higgs boson SM-like?
DESCRIPTION:The properties of the Higgs boson discovered in 2012 at the LHC are consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model (SM), to within the accuracy of the present LHC Higgs data.  Nevertheless, there are numerous motivations to suggest that the scalar sector of the fundamental theory of particles is likely to be non-minimal, in contrast to the minimal scalar sector of the SM.   If an extended Higgs sector exists, then why should the observed Higgs boson closely resemble the Higgs boson of the SM?  In this talk, I examine the possibility that the Higgs boson is SM-like due to a softly-broken symmetry,   The size of the corresponding soft-breaking terms ultimately determines the small deviations of the Higgs couplings from their SM values, which can be discovered in future LHC running (or at a Higgs factory that may eventually follow).  If such a scenario can be realized, then it would provide a natural explanation for the SM-like properties of the observed Higgs boson, while allowing for the existence of new scalars (and perhaps other new particles beyond the SM) whose presence can be probed in future runs at the LHC.

SUMMARY:Maurizio Pierini - Deep Learning & the future of the LHC search program
DESCRIPTION:We discuss how Deep Learning could be used to help our quest for new physics at the LHC. After introducing the basic ingredients, we review how new search strategies could be designed, exploiting new opportunities offered by Deep Learning. We then discuss how Deep Learning could indirectly serve the search program, freeing online and offline computing resources, speeding up demanding tasks, e.g., event reconstruction and detector simulation. These resources could be used to extend the search program in new directions. As an example, the proposal of an anomalous event dataset will be discussed.

SUMMARY:Chris McCabe - Hunting for sub-GeV dark matter with gas-based detectors
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, I’ll discuss ideas for new approaches in the hunt for light dark matter was gas-based detectors. Firstly, I’ll discuss the sensitivity that may be achievable through the process of electron ionisation of gas targets in a Spherical Proportional Counter, paying particular attention to the potential benefits of molecular gas targets. Secondly, I’ll review the Migdal effect and discuss ongoing attempts to measure the effect in a neutron-nuclear scattering process with a CF4 gas mixture in an Optical Time Projection Chamber.

SUMMARY:Felix Kahlhoefer - Searching for sub-GeV dark matter
DESCRIPTION:The non-observation of evidence for conventional dark matter candidates such as WIMPs has led to a growing interest in less explored mass ranges. In this talk I will give an overview of the phenomenology of sub-GeV dark matter. I will explain how we can use cosmology as a guiding principle to identify interesting models, featuring for example resonant or forbidden annihilations or inelastic scattering. I will then discuss how to probe these models in laboratory experiments, with a focus on searches for long-lived particles in high-intensity accelerators like Belle II and searches for electron recoils in underground experiments like XENON1T.

SUMMARY:Matthew Buckley - Unsupervised Machine Learning in Astrophysical Data
DESCRIPTION:Large astrophysical surveys provide us with a wealth of data that has important implications for fundamental physics questions. Fully exploiting these datasets requires new techniques and approaches, including machine learning. However, it is difficult to completely simulate many astrophysical systems. As a result, unsupervised learning techniques can be particularly useful for these astrophysical questions. I discuss two applications of unsupervised machine learning to astrophysical data: discovering stellar streams and measuring the local Galactic density.

SUMMARY:Gino Isidori - B anomalies and the flavor of SMEFT
DESCRIPTION:Recent data in B-meson decays indicate a coherent pattern of deviations from the Standard Model predictions. These 'anomalies' provide a perfect playground for using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) in a bottom-up approach, not only to set limits on the scale of the New Physics, but also to extract precise indications about the nature of physics beyond the SM. I will discuss, in particular, how present data points toward new dynamics not far from the TeV scale,  possibly by linked to the origin of fermion mass hierarchies, and to the unification of quarks and leptons. Implications for future measurements both at low and high-energies are also briefly discussed.

SUMMARY:Ciaran O'Hare - Venturing into the neutrino fog
DESCRIPTION:The last few years have seen the largest underground dark matter searches rapidly approach their purported ultimate sensitivity limit, which is increasingly being referred to as the "neutrino fog". An experiment reaches the neutrino fog went it becomes so large and so sensitive that the background from coherent scattering of astrophysical neutrinos begins to masquerade as dark matter, thereby preventing any conclusive identification of a signal. The encroachment of the neutrino fog has driven an increase in interest towards a technique which has the potential to circumvent the limit entirely: directional detection. The technique aims to measure the strongly anisotropic angular distribution of the dark matter wind incident on Earth as we journey around the Milky Way galaxy. The potential for dark matter discovery with directional detectors greatly exceeds that of conventional detectors, so the concept is well worth investigation if we 1) want to extend the search for dark matter well into the neutrino fog, or 2) wish to confirm a potential signal of dark matter without relying on the controversial and systematic-prone annual modulation. While in practice directional detectors are several years away from being at a competitive scale, there several promising approaches under investigation. The CYGNUS collaboration in particular is developing a competitive global network of directional detectors using modular gas time projection chambers. I will give an overview of the status of neutrino backgrounds to dark matter searches and then describe ongoing work trying to bring the concept of directional detection to reality.

SUMMARY:Tilman Plehn - Forward and Inverse LHC Simulations with Neural Networks
DESCRIPTION:LHC physics is a unique field in the sense that we compare vast and highly complex data sets with precise first-principles predictions. Generative neural networks can supplement these simulations and come with conceptional advantages.  I will show how flow-based invertible networks can provide precision simulations with uncertainty estimates and a high level of control through a new, GAN-inspired architecture.  In addition, I will discuss how such networks can invert event simulations and unfold detector simulations or the QCD parton shower in a mathemacially consistent manner.

SUMMARY:Archil Kobakhidze - Gravitational instantons, CP asymmetry, and axions
DESCRIPTION:Quantum gravity effects are typically considered irrelevant for particle physics and its phenomenology. Contrary to this, I will argue that non-perturbative quantum gravity effects associated with charged gravitational instantons have significant implications for the understanding of the observed quantisation of electric charge and an additional CP violation within the Standard Model. More specifically, I will discuss how the coloured Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons invalidate the Peccei-Quinn axion solution to the strong CP problem and suggest that the genuine axionic solution of the problem must involve an additional companion axion. Some phenomenological and cosmological aspects of the companion axion model will be presented.

SUMMARY:Tracy Slatyer - Dark Matter Puzzles from Indirect Searches
DESCRIPTION:The nature and origin of dark matter is one of the key unresolved questions of fundamental physics. Astrophysical and cosmological data provide powerful probes of dark matter properties, although to date no signal has been confirmed. I will discuss a number of claimed possible signals of novel dark matter physics in astrophysical datasets, alternative explanations, and open questions, with a focus on the Galactic Center Excess in GeV-scale gamma rays.

SUMMARY:Jonathan Feng - FASER and Forward Physics at the LHC
DESCRIPTION:For decades, the focus of searches for new particles at the energy frontier has been on heavy particles and high $p_T$. Recently, however, new ideas have led to novel opportunities for discovery in the forward region with relatively fast, small, and cheap experiments. In this talk, I will give an overview of the physics motivations, including both BSM and SM physics; describe FASER, currently being installed at the LHC; and present a few new initiatives, including a forward LAr detector and the Forward Physics Facility.

SUMMARY:Nicole Bell - Dark Matter Capture in Stars
DESCRIPTION:The capture of dark matter in stars provides a cosmic laboratory in which to study the nature of dark matter particles and their interactions. We outline an improved treatment of the dark matter capture process, which correctly incorporates a number of important, yet previously overlooked, physical effects. We discuss observational consequences for capture in the Sun, white dwarfs and neutron stars.

SUMMARY:Leszek Roszkowski - Direct detection of dark matter - a theorist’s perspective
DESCRIPTION:Measurement of a signal in direct detection of a hypothetical particle constituting the dark matter in the Universe  would provide arguably the most convincing proof of its nature. The problem is that we do not really know what the dark matter is. However, we do have some very good candidates for it. I will discuss to what extent current and future experimental efforts will be able to verify our ideas and/or open up other perspectives.

SUMMARY:Marc Kamionkowski - The Hubble tension and early dark energy
DESCRIPTION:We've known since the late 1920s that the Universe is expanding. However, the expansion rate currently inferred from measurements of the cosmic microwave background now disagrees with that obtained from supernova measurements. Over the past few years, theorists have been exploring the possibility that this Hubble tension is explained by some new "early dark energy": a new component of matter that may have been dynamically important several hundred thousand years after the Big Bang.

SUMMARY:Pierre Sikivie - Axion Dark Matter
DESCRIPTION: The axion is a hypothetical particle motivated by the strong CP problem of elementary particle physics and by the dark matter problem of cosmology. Cold dark matter axions are naturally produced during the QCD phase transition in the early universe by a process of vacuum realignment. They thermalize later by gravitational self-interactions and form a Bose-Einstein condensate as a result of this thermalization. I'll discuss special properties that may allow us to distinguish axion dark matter from the other dark matter candidates on observational grounds.  I'll also discuss various methods to detect axion dark matter directly on Earth, and report on the experimental efforts under way.

Soon the new Fermilab $g-2$ measurement will publish its first data. In view of this we present an overview of the current situation and discuss general properties of BSM contributions to muon $g-2$.
