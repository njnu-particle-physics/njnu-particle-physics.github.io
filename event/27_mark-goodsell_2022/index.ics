SUMMARY:Mark Goodsell - Automating generic phenomenology
DESCRIPTION:Experimental searches typically publish limits on not only specific models, but specific scenarios within a model. For a theorist to confront a different model or scenario to the latest limits therefore requires a whole chain of tools and calculations to map from Lagrangian parameters to data. With the immense range of possible models now under consideration this begs for automation and genericity. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the state of the art of this toolchain and the current challenges within the context of the SARAH package, which allows phenomenologists to go from a theory defined at any energy scale to precision computations and collider tools at the push of a button. I will also talk about my recent work on generic unitarity calculations and their relation to dark matter.
